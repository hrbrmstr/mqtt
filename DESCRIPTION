Description: 'MQTT' is a machine-to-machine ('M2M')/"Internet of Things" connectivity 
    protocol. It was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging 
    transport. It is useful for connections with remote locations where a small code 
    footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium. For example, it has 
    been used in sensors communicating to a broker via satellite link, over occasional 
    dial-up connections with healthcare providers, and in a range of home automation and
    small device scenarios. It is also ideal for mobile applications because of its small
    size, low power usage, minimised data packets, and efficient distribution of
    information to one or many receivers. Tools are provided to interoperate with 'MQTT' 
    message brokers in R.
